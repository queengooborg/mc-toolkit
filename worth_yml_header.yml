# Known Issues/To-Do:
#   Firework Rockets have a flat price and need different pricing for each type (help wanted)
#   Selling potions will always use the base price and does not use pricing specific to each type (help wanted)
#   Smithing templates and pottery sherds have a uniform price for each respective item type and need to be separated (help wanted)

#
# Changelog:
#   1.20.x (part 2):
#     Fixes the prices for andesite, diorite and granite
#     Some 1.21.x items were added as the recipes had been added into the 1.20.4 source code
#
#   1.20.x:
#     Complete overhaul! All values are now generated by scanning the Minecraft source code for recipes, given a few base values, see https://github.com/queengooborg/mc-toolkit. This should allow for adding new items much easier (as has been determined with the new items added in this update)
#     Add items introduced in 1.20.x
